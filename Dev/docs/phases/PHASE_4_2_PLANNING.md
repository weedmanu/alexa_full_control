# PHASE 4.2 PLANNING - CLI Commands Refactoring

**Status:** Planning phase  
**Date:** 16 octobre 2025  
**Objective:** Refactor 15+ CLI commands to use ManagerCommand template  
**Expected Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Target:** 100% backward compatible, all 150 tests passing

## üéØ Refactoring Pattern

### Current Pattern (Old)

```python
class DeviceCommand(BaseCommand):
    """Command class."""

    def setup_parser(self, parser):
        """Setup argparse."""
        # Manual parser setup

    def execute(self, args):
        """Execute command."""
        # Manual execution logic
        device_name = args.device
        # ... manual logic ...
```

### Target Pattern (New - Using ManagerCommand)

```python
class DeviceListCommand(ManagerCommand):
    """List devices command."""

    def get_manager(self):
        """Get DeviceManager from DI container."""
        return self.di_container.get(DeviceManager)

    def validate(self):
        """Validate prerequisites."""
        return True

    def execute(self):
        """Execute with validated manager."""
        devices = self.manager.get_devices()
        return devices

    def help(self):
        """Return help text."""
        return "List all connected devices"
```

## üìä Implementation Strategy

### Phase 4.2a: Create Adapter Layer (5-10 min)

- Create `cli/commands/adapter.py` with adapter pattern
- Allow old BaseCommand classes to work with new DI system
- Ensure backward compatibility during transition

### Phase 4.2b: Refactor Music Commands (30-45 min)

1. **Music Playback** (Most complex)

   - Create individual command classes for each action
   - PlaybackPlayCommand, PlaybackPauseCommand, etc.
   - Integrate with PlaybackManager via DI

2. **Music Library/Status/TuneIn** (3 commands)
   - Similar pattern
   - Parallel refactoring

### Phase 4.2c: Refactor Device/Routine/Alarm (30-45 min)

- Device commands (2 methods)
- Routine commands (4+ methods) - Use new RoutineManager!
- Alarm commands (3 methods)
- Lists commands (3 methods)

### Phase 4.2d: Refactor Remaining Commands (15-30 min)

- Activity, Reminder, DND, SmartHome, Calendar
- Multiroom, Timers, Auth, Cache
- Most are simple wrappers

### Phase 4.2e: Testing & Validation (20-30 min)

- Run all 150 existing tests
- Verify backward compatibility
- Fix any regressions
- Commit and push

---

## üîÑ Integration Points

### DI Container Integration

```python
# In cli/command_parser.py or main entry point
di_container = DIContainer.instance()

# For each command
command = DeviceListCommand(di_container)
result = command.execute()
```

### Manager Access Pattern

```python
class ManagerCommand(BaseCommand):
    def __init__(self, di_container):
        self.di_container = di_container
        self.manager = None

    def get_manager_type(self):
        """Override in subclass."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    def execute(self, args):
        """Get manager from DI, then execute."""
        manager_type = self.get_manager_type()
        self.manager = self.di_container.get(manager_type)
        return self.run(args)
```

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

- [ ] All 150 CLI tests passing
- [ ] All 43 RoutineManager tests passing
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained (old command syntax still works)
- [ ] New ManagerCommand pattern used for all commands
- [ ] DIContainer properly integrated
- [ ] All error cases handled
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Code follows project style (mypy strict, Black formatted)
- [ ] Docstrings updated for all refactored commands
- [ ] Git commits organized by command batch

## üìù Commit Strategy

### Commits (Suggested Order)

1. `feat(Phase 4.2): add command adapter layer for DI integration`
2. `refactor(Phase 4.2): music commands to use ManagerCommand template`
3. `refactor(Phase 4.2): device/routine/alarm commands to ManagerCommand`
4. `refactor(Phase 4.2): remaining commands to ManagerCommand`
5. `test(Phase 4.2): verify all 150 tests passing, zero regressions`

## üéì Learning Outcomes

This phase demonstrates:

- Adapter patterns in Python
- Gradual refactoring in live codebases
- Dependency injection in CLI applications
- Maintaining backward compatibility during refactoring
- Large-scale refactoring best practices

---

## üìû Implementation Notes

- **Start with:** Music/Playback (most complex, establishes pattern)
- **Key Pattern:** Each command method ‚Üí separate ManagerCommand subclass
- **Testing:** Run pytest after each batch to catch regressions early
- **DI Integration:** Use DIContainer.instance() for singleton access
- **Backward Compat:** Keep old BaseCommand subclasses working during transition

---

**Next:** Create adapter layer and start BATCH 1 refactoring
