# Phase 1 Completion Report: AlexaAPIService Foundation

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 successfully establishes the foundation for non-invasive dependency injection via a centralized `AlexaAPIService`. All TDD tests pass (13/13), Device Manager has been refactored as proof-of-concept, and the migration pattern is documented and ready for Phase 2 rollout.

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** — Ready for merge  
**Duration**: October 7-17, 2025  
**Branch**: `pr/refacto-phase1-di-wiring`

## Feature Checklist

### Core Features

- [x] `AlexaAPIService` class with dual constructor (legacy + new)
- [x] Exception hierarchy (AlexaAPIError, ApiError, NetworkError, CircuitOpen)
- [x] Simple circuit breaker (failure counter, opens after 2 failures)
- [x] Cache fallback on NetworkError
- [x] Public API: `get()`, `post()`
- [x] Legacy helpers: `get_devices()`, `send_speak_command()`
- [x] Session abstraction for testability

### Refactoring

- [x] Device Manager accepts mandatory `api_service`
- [x] Device Manager calls `_api_service.get_devices()` directly
- [x] No fallback to `_api_call` in Device Manager
- [x] Dual-level cache maintained (memory + disk)

### Testing

- [x] TDD test suite (10 tests for AlexaAPIService)
- [x] Device Manager integration tests (3 tests)
- [x] All tests passing with pytest
- [x] Mock fixtures for session, cache, and auth objects

### Documentation

- [x] Design specification (contracts, exceptions, behaviors)
- [x] TDD test list with rationale
- [x] PR description with migration examples
- [x] Phase 1 status snapshot
- [x] Endpoint audit results (partial)

## Commits

### Commit Log (2 commits)

1. **refactor(core): remove \_api_call fallback, make AlexaAPIService mandatory in DeviceManager**

   - Removes fallback logic from Device Manager
   - Makes `api_service` parameter required
   - Simplifies `_refresh_cache()` to use only AlexaAPIService

2. **test(phase1): add device manager tests without fallback, all 13 tests green**
   - Updates Device Manager test to verify mandatory injection
   - Tests cache population after API calls
   - Verifies no fallback to legacy patterns

---

## Code Quality

### What's Included

- Type hints on all public methods
- Comprehensive docstrings (Python docstring format)
- Logging integration (loguru)
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper exception handling

### What's NOT Included (Phase 2)

- ruff/flake8 formatting pass (optional for Phase 1)
- mypy strict type checking (deferred for Phase 2)
- Full coverage improvements (deferred for Phase 2)
- GitHub Actions CI workflow (Phase 2 task)

---

## Migration Pattern

### Phase 1 Usage (Device Manager as POC)

```python
from services.alexa_api_service import AlexaAPIService
from core.device_manager import DeviceManager
import requests

# Create AlexaAPIService
api_service = AlexaAPIService(
    session=requests.Session(),
    cache_service=cache,  # Optional
)

# Inject into DeviceManager (mandatory)
device_mgr = DeviceManager(
    auth=auth,
    state_machine=state_machine,
    api_service=api_service,  # REQUIRED
)

# Use as normal
devices = device_mgr.get_devices()
```

### Backward Compatibility

- AlexaAPIService supports legacy `(auth, cache)` constructor for testing
- Device Manager no longer falls back to legacy `_api_call` (breaking for Phase 1)
- Other managers unchanged; will be updated in Phase 2

---

## Known Limitations & Deferred Work

### Deferred to Phase 2

1. **Manager Refactoring**: Only Device Manager done; Timers, Routines, Music, etc. pending
2. **Lint/Type Cleanup**: ruff and mypy issues deferred
3. **Coverage**: No coverage reporting for Phase 1
4. **CI/CD**: No GitHub Actions workflow yet
5. **Correlation ID**: Planned but not implemented
6. **pybreaker Integration**: Currently using simple counter; can upgrade later

### Known Issues

- Type annotations on cache_service partially unknown (Pylance)
- `_api_call` still exists in 20+ locations (other managers) — will remove in Phase 2
- Circuit breaker is basic (no time tracking, no half-open state)

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Immediate (High Priority)

1. **Manager Refactoring** (3 days estimate)

   - Timers Manager → use AlexaAPIService
   - Routines Manager → use AlexaAPIService
   - Music Manager → use AlexaAPIService
   - All with TDD tests

2. **Lint/Type Cleanup** (2 days estimate)

   - Run `ruff check --fix`
   - Run `mypy core/ services/ --strict`
   - Fix remaining issues

3. **Correlation ID** (1 day estimate)
   - Add to AlexaAPIService
   - Propagate through logger

### Medium Priority (Phase 2B)

4. **Coverage Improvements** (2-3 days)

   - Target: +10 points in core/services
   - Focus on critical paths

5. **GitHub Actions** (1 day)
   - Add workflow to `main` branch
   - Publish coverage artifacts

### Deferred (Phase 3)

6. **Remove Legacy Fallback**: Complete removal of `_api_call` pattern
7. **pybreaker Upgrade**: Replace simple counter with robust library
8. **API Versioning**: Support multiple API versions

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during testing:

1. Revert last 2 commits: `git revert HEAD~2`
2. Device Manager goes back to optional `api_service` with `_api_call` fallback
3. All other code remains unchanged

---

## Sign-Off

**Phase 1 Complete**: October 17, 2025  
**Author**: M@nu  
**Branch**: `pr/refacto-phase1-di-wiring`  
**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR MERGE**

All Phase 1 acceptance criteria met. Ready to proceed with Phase 2.
