"""Communication Schemas Tests - Phase 3.6 (TDD)

Tests for communication-related DTOs.
Write tests FIRST, then implement schemas.

Test Coverage:
- SpeakCommandRequest with camelCase aliasing
- AnnounceCommandRequest validation
- CommunicationResponse immutability
- BroadcastResponse device counting
- ConversationResponse transcript parsing
- Field aliasing (deviceSerialNumber â†” device_serial)
- Immutability enforcement
- Auto-timestamping
