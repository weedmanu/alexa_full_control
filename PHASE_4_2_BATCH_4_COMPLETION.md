## 📁 Phase 4.2 Architecture

### Refactored Command Files

```
cli/commands/
├── music/
│   ├── playback_commands.py         ← 7 music playback commands
│   ├── library_commands.py          ← (future: library commands)
│   └── ...
│
├── device_routine_alarm_commands.py ← 8 commands (device, routine, alarm)
├── announcements_activity_reminder_commands.py ← 7 commands
├── dnd_smarthome_calendar_multiroom_commands.py ← 10 commands
├── timers_auth_cache_commands.py    ← 8 commands
│
└── [DEPRECATED - for backward compatibility]
    ├── playback.py                  (old monolithic)
    ├── device.py                    (old monolithic)
    ├── routine.py                   (old monolithic)
    ├── alarm.py                     (old monolithic)
    └── ... (other original files)
```

### Command Hierarchy

All commands follow the same pattern:

```
BaseCommand
    ↓
    ├── PlaybackPlayCommand, PlaybackPauseCommand, etc.
    ├── DeviceListCommand, DeviceInfoCommand, etc.
    ├── AnnouncementBroadcastCommand, AnnouncementSendCommand, etc.
    ├── DNDGetCommand, DNDSetCommand, DNDDeleteCommand, etc.
    ├── TimerAddCommand, TimerListCommand, TimerDeleteCommand, etc.
    └── ... (40 total command classes)

Each uses:
    - CommandAdapter for DIContainer access
    - Inherited BaseCommand methods (error, success, info, format_table, etc.)
    - Lazy-loaded managers via adapter.get_manager()
```

## 📊 Code Statistics

### Phase 4.2 Contribution

- **Total New Lines:** 2,088 lines (BATCH 1-3) + 390 (BATCH 4 doc) = **2,478 lines**
- **New Files:** 5 command files + 4 completion docs = **9 files**
- **Commands Refactored:** 40 (100% of CLI)
- **Classes Created:** 40 BaseCommand subclasses
- **Test Executions:** 12+ test runs, all 150 passing
- **Commits:** 4 (BATCH 1-4)
- **No Regressions:** ✅ Verified after each commit

## 🔗 Integration with Previous Phases

### Phase 6 (RoutineManager) Integration

BATCH 2 integrated the NEW Phase 6 RoutineManager:

- `RoutineCreateCommand` uses `RoutineManager.create_routine()`
- `RoutineExecuteCommand` uses `RoutineManager.execute_routine()`
- `RoutineListCommand` uses `RoutineManager.get_routines()`

**Result:** Seamless integration between Phase 4.2 and Phase 6 ✅

### DIContainer & CommandAdapter Integration

All commands use the adapter pattern created in Phase 4.2 Foundation:

```python
adapter = get_command_adapter()
manager = adapter.get_manager("ManagerName")
```

**Result:** Clean separation of concerns, testable, maintainable ✅
